...Ecommerece PERN app in process of building/completion. Will update later...
# PERN-Ecommerce-Store-project
This is **Portfolio Project #5** for my Full-stack web development course on Codecademy. This app is an Ecommerce store, names ***Reef Budz***,  where aquarists can browse and purchase saltwater creatures and coral fragments for their own saltwater reef tanks. Built using PERN (*PostgreSQL*, *Express*, *React*, *Node*) stack, this web app is a fully-functioning Ecommerce store with features common in most real-world Ecommerce stores.

## II. Tech Stack

- **Vite**            — Main Web app development and build tool. Enables dividing the code between **React** frontend and **Node**/**Express** backend.
- **React**           — Frontend library for building user interfaces and their components.
- **Node**            — Provides a JavaScript runtime environment to run server-side scripts on backend.
- **Express**         — Backend framework used to define API endpoints that interact with database. Also used to setup a web server for handling HTTP/HTTPS request from React frontend/client-side.
- **PostgreSQL**      — Database of choice for app. Used to store product data, user accounts, and order history and details of users.
- **Render.com**      — Cloud platform used to host the **React** frontend/client-side as well as the **Node**/**Express** backend.
- **Neon.com**        — Cloud platform used to host web app's ***PostgreSQL*** database. Database interfaces with the app hosted on **Render.com**.
- **React packages**  — imported packages for both frontend/client-side (**React**) as well as backend/server-side (**Node**/**Express**).
- **CSS**             — used for styling purposes.
