# Enforce LF (Unix-style) line endings for code and SQL files.
# This prevents Git from converting LF to CRLF on Windows systems,
# ensuring consistent line endings across all operating systems
# (Linux, macOS, and Windows).

# Tip for contributors:
# - You usually do NOT need to change this.
# - Only change `eol=lf` to `eol=crlf` if:
#   → you're working exclusively on Windows, and
#   → your tooling **requires** CRLF (rare for modern projects).
# - Most tools (VS Code, PostgreSQL, linters, etc.) work best with LF.
